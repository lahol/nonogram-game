# Nonogram-game #

Play nonograms on your computer.

Nonogram-game supports a human-readable input-file format, so you can create
new puzzles by yourself using just a simple text editor.

Nonogram-game lets you tick off and lock squares using the left or
the right mouse button, respectively. Large puzzles (i.e. not fitting completely
in the window) may be scrolled. Hints also may be ticked off.
